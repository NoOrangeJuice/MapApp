This project is part of Udacity's Full-Stack Web Developer nanodegree. Visit: http://www.Udacity.com for more information on courses and nanodegrees. Through doing this project I learned how to use multiple API's in tandem with each other and how to utilize the Knockout.js JavaScript framework.
<hr>
This application was developed using Google App Engine and the Knockout.js framework as well as jQuery. Some CSS is borrowed from the Skeleton CSS framework which can be viewed here: http://getskeleton.com/
